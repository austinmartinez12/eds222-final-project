       Lakes in the Midwest and Northeast United States are at risk of anthropogenic chloride
        contamination, but we have little knowledge of the prevalence and spatial distribution of
        the problem. The majority of salt pollution in north temperate regions stems from road salt
        application but other chloride sources include water softeners, synthetic fertilizers, and
        livestock excretion. Although chloride contamination of lakes is well documented, it is
        unknown how many lakes are at risk of long-term salinization. We used a quantile regression
        forest to leverage information from 2,773 lakes to predict the chloride concentration of all
        49,432 lakes greater than 4 ha in a 17-state area. The QRF used 22 predictor variables,
        which included lake morphometry characteristics, watershed land use, and distance to the
        nearest interstate and road. Model predictions had an r2 of 0.94 for all chloride
        observations, and 0.87 for predictions of the mean chloride concentration observed at each
        lake.

           We leveraged publicly available land use, lake catchment and morphometry, and
            climate data across a 17-state area of the Midwest and Northeast United States, to
            predict chloride concentrations in 49,432 lakes. Our general methodology included: 1)
            Acquiring and geoprocessing lake water quality data and site characteristics. 2)
            Harmonizing training datasets. 3) Building a machine learning model for chloride
            prediction. Calculating model fit. 4) Building a prediction dataset for 49,432 lakes. 
           Training Dataset 
           Observational chloride measurements from lakes, reservoirs, and impoundments were
            downloaded from the US water quality portal (WQP). All results were converted to mg L-1,
            and only data with ResultStatusIdentifier as Accepted or Final noted in the dataset were retained. The initial search of 115,389 observations was
            then filtered to data collected after 1990, chloride concentrations &lt; 10,000 mg
            L-1, and water samples less than 10 m deep or with depth not listed (where the
            assumption was an epilimnion measurement). These quality control steps were taken to
            limit inclusion of historical data that may not represent current conditions, remove
            naturally saline waterbodies (n =5, adjacent/connected to the Atlantic Ocean), and
            remove potentially meromictic lakes (n=0). Multiple observations collected on the same
            day were averaged. Lakes with missing watershed information were removed, resulting in
            29,675 unique daily observations from 2,773 lakes. Three states (Illinois, Iowa, and
            Rhode Island) had no chloride data, and three states (Pennsylvania, Connecticut, and New
            Hampshire) had chloride data from only one lake. 2,773 lakes represent 5% of the
            region’s lakes. 
           WQP site identification numbers (IDs) from the dataset were linked to the
            high-resolution National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) that accessed bounding box
            information of each NHD shapefile and ran a spatial join. The resulting relational table
            linked each chloride observation to an individual lake through an NHD ID. For every NHD
            lake ID, geospatial lake data were obtained from the LAGOS-NE database (Soranno et
            al. 2017), which provides watershed ecological context for all lakes greater than 4 ha
            in the 17-state area. Additional site characteristics were extracted from GIS line files
            of US interstates, US primary roads, and gridded winter severity data. Across all
            predictor variables in the training dataset, minimum values were &gt;= 0.01. After
            converting zero values to 0.001, all data were log-transformed. 
          
             Machine Learning Model 
             A quantile regression forest (QRF) was used to model the relationship between
            observed chloride concentrations and lake and watershed characteristics. This model was
            chosen to accommodate a large number of correlated predictor variables, the presence of
            non-linear responses, and the potential importance of interactions among predictor
            variables. The QRF was implemented with 1,000 trees using the ranger package in R, with
            mtry set to 4 (Wright and Ziegler 2017). 
             To avoid overfitting the QRF to lakes with a greater number of chloride
            observations, we developed a customized sampling routine that constructed individual
            trees using the observations from a random subset of the study lakes (95% subset: the in-bag samples). Each resulting tree was used to make out-of-bag predictions on the remaining
            observations from the 5% of excluded lakes. All predictions are reported as the median
            of the terminal node values from each tree, with the corresponding 90%-prediction
            interval calculated from the .05 and 0.95 quantiles of the estimated conditional
            distribution of the response variable (Meinshausen 2006). Median terminal node values
            were chosen over mean values because they had superior predictive performance on
            out-of-bag observations. 
          
          
             Prediction Dataset 
             A prediction dataset was constructed for the full LAGOS-NE dataset, which contained
            51,102 lakes and reservoirs greater than 4 ha in the 17-state area. After removing lakes
            with no available land-use data because the watersheds crossed the US/Canada border,
            49,432 lakes remained, of which 2,773 were used for training the model. The prediction
            dataset was identical in structure to the training dataset, but contained no
            observational chloride data. 
          
          
            Wisconsin Lake Chloride Observations
            Independent measurements were taken from Wisconsin Lakes in the summer of 2018. Samples were taken from the surface of each lake, and analyzed for chloride (and sulfate) simultaneously by Ion Chromatography, using a hydroxide eluent. The detection limit for chloride is approximately 0.01 ppm. Chloride is determined by a Dionex model ICS 2100 using an electro-chemical suppressor.
